# Known issues

Things that are wrong, reproduced and measured, with where to look. Each one says what is
actually happening rather than what it looks like, so that whoever picks it up does not have to
re-derive it from a screenshot.

## The ground you stand on and the ground you see disagree at city terraces

**Seen:** riding along the lake shore below Ambron (Elagos, by the Drowned Causeway), the horse
and rider are buried to the chest in the bank. The rider sits above a flat tan wedge of terrain
and the horse's body is inside it.

**It is not the horse.** The mount is standing exactly where the game thinks the ground is. The
drawn ground is somewhere else.

**Measured.** At `(-1252, 353)`, just outside Ambron's south wall:

| | height |
|---|---|
| `world.heightAt` — where the player stands, and what every collision uses | **0.65 m** (lake level) |
| the terrain triangle drawn at that point | **10.73 m** |
| difference | **10.08 m** |

So the traveler is ten metres inside the visible bank. Anywhere along the foot of that wall is
somewhere between fine and ten metres wrong.

**Cause.** Two different surfaces:

- `heightAt` is analytic. `AMBRON_TERRACE` (`src/region-world.js`) is a pad at level 17.2 with a
  30 m feather, and near the wall it goes from lake level to city level over a very short run.
- The terrain *mesh* is a grid built by `axisSamples` in `src/world.js`. That function only
  spaces vertices 2.5 m apart inside one fine band — the one around Tidehaven and the Avrel
  clearing — and coarsens to **7.1 m everywhere else**, which is all of Elagos.

A 7.1 m triangle cannot hold a step that tall. It smears the terrace wall across one cell, and
in the middle of that cell the drawn surface is ~10 m above the surface you walk on.

It is not only Ambron: the same measurement around Tidehaven, inside the *fine* band, still finds
4.6 m of disagreement at the nearest hard edge. Every terrain pad in `TERRAIN_PADS` has the same
shape of problem; Ambron is the worst because it is the tallest pad and the furthest from the fine
band.

**Ways out, roughly in order of how much they cost:**

1. Give `axisSamples` a list of fine windows instead of one, and include a band around every pad
   edge in `TERRAIN_PADS` (plus `AMBRON_TERRACE`). Fixes the cause everywhere. Costs vertices —
   needs a count before and after, because this is the world's single biggest geometry.
2. Widen the feather on the pads that sit on a shore, so the analytic step is gentle enough for a
   7.1 m grid to follow. Cheap, changes how the cities sit in their landscape.
3. Build the pad edges as their own geometry (a retaining wall / revetment) and let the terrain
   stay coarse behind it. Most control, most work, and arguably the right answer for a city that
   is *supposed* to stand on made ground with a wall around it.

**Repro:** ride south-east out of Ambron toward the Drowned Causeway and follow the water's edge
under the south wall.
